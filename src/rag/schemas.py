"""Stable contract for the RAG service.

``POST /api/query`` is the **production** retrieval entrypoint that
downstream consumers (LLM generation, future Telegram bot, frontend)
will call. Unlike ``POST /api/retrieve`` — which exposes the full
diagnostic surface for evaluation and tuning — ``/api/query`` only
takes *semantic* parameters and returns a stable, stripped result
shape.

The split is deliberate: ``/api/retrieve`` will keep evolving as we
tune RRF weights, add channels, swap the reranker. ``/api/query`` is
the contract we promise to keep stable. Server-side defaults
(`retrieval_collection`, `retrieval_rerank_default`,
`retrieval_expand_parents_default` from settings) decide pipeline
behaviour — clients do not pass them.
